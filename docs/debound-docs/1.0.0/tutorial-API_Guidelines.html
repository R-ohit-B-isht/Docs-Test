Abstract</h2><p>The Microsoft REST API Guidelines, as a design principle, encourages application developers to have resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on platforms following the Microsoft REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive.</p><p>This document establishes the guidelines Microsoft REST APIs SHOULD follow so RESTful interfaces are developed consistently.</p><h2 id="2.-table-of-contents">2.

Introduction</h2><p>Developers access most Microsoft Cloud Platform resources via HTTP interfaces. Although each service typically provides language-specific frameworks to wrap their APIs, all of their operations eventually boil down to HTTP requests. Microsoft must support a wide range of clients and services and cannot rely on rich frameworks being available for every development environment. Thus, a goal of these guidelines is to ensure Microsoft REST APIs can be easily and consistently consumed by any client with basic HTTP support.</p><p>To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers, it's important to have these APIs follow consistent design guidelines, thus making using them easy and intuitive. This document establishes the guidelines to be followed by Microsoft REST API developers for developing such APIs consistently.</p><p>The benefits of consistency accrue in aggregate as well; consistency allows teams to leverage common code, patterns, documentation and design decisions.</p><p>These guidelines aim to achieve the following:</p><ul><li>Define consistent practices and patterns for all API endpoints across Microsoft.</li><li>Adhere as closely as possible to accepted REST/HTTP best practices in the industry at-large. [*]</li><li>Make accessing Microsoft Services via REST interfaces easy for all application developers.</li><li>Allow service developers to leverage the prior work of other services to implement, test and document REST endpoints defined consistently.</li><li>Allow for partners (e.g., non-Microsoft entities) to use these guidelines for their own REST endpoint design.</li></ul><p>[*] Note: The guidelines are designed to align with building services which comply with the REST architectural style, though they do not address or require building services that follow the REST constraints. The term &quot;REST&quot; is used throughout this document to mean services that are in the spirit of REST rather than adhering to REST by the book.*</p><h3 id="3.1.-recommended-reading">3.1. Recommended reading</h3><p>Understanding the philosophy behind the REST Architectural Style is recommended for developing good HTTP-based services. If you are new to RESTful design, here are some good resources:</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST on Wikipedia</a> -- Overview of common definitions and core ideas behind REST.</p><p><a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">REST Dissertation</a> -- The chapter on REST in Roy Fielding's dissertation on Network Architecture, &quot;Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures&quot;</p><p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC 7231</a> -- Defines the specification for HTTP/1.1 semantics, and is considered the authoritative resource.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/REST-Practice-Hypermedia-Systems-Architecture/dp/0596805829/">REST in Practice</a> -- Book on the fundamentals of REST.</p><h2 id="4.-interpreting-the-guidelines">4. Interpreting the guidelines</h2><h3 id="4.1.-application-of-the-guidelines">4.1. Application of the guidelines</h3><p>These guidelines are applicable to any REST API exposed publicly by Microsoft or any partner service. Private or internal APIs SHOULD also try to follow these guidelines because internal services tend to eventually be exposed publicly. Consistency is valuable to not only external customers but also internal service consumers, and these guidelines offer best practices useful for any service.</p><p>There are legitimate reasons for exemption from these guidelines. Obviously, a REST service that implements or must interoperate with some externally defined REST API must be compatible with that API and not necessarily these guidelines. Some services MAY also have special performance needs that require a different format, such as a binary protocol.</p><h3 id="4.2.-guidelines-for-existing-services-and-versioning-of-services">4.2. Guidelines for existing services and versioning of services</h3><p>We do not recommend making a breaking change to a service that predates these guidelines simply for the sake of compliance. The service SHOULD try to become compliant at the next version release when compatibility is being broken anyway. When a service adds a new API, that API SHOULD be consistent with the other APIs of the same version. So if a service was written against version 1.0 of the guidelines, new APIs added incrementally to the service SHOULD also follow version 1.0. The service can then upgrade to align with the latest version of the guidelines at the service's next major release.</p><h3 id="4.3.-requirements-language">4.3. Requirements language</h3><p>The keywords &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.</p><h3 id="4.4.-license">4.4.

Taxonomy</h2><p>As part of onboarding to Microsoft REST API Guidelines, services MUST comply with the taxonomy defined below.</p><h3 id="5.1.-errors">5.1. Errors</h3><p>Errors, or more specifically Service Errors, are defined as a client passing invalid data to the service and the service <em>correctly</em> rejecting that data. Examples include invalid credentials, incorrect parameters, unknown version IDs, or similar. These are generally &quot;4xx&quot; HTTP error codes and are the result of a client passing incorrect or invalid data.</p><p>Errors do <em>not</em> contribute to overall API availability.</p><h3 id="5.2.-faults">5.2. Faults</h3><p>Faults, or more specifically Service Faults, are defined as the service failing to correctly return in response to a valid client request. These are generally &quot;5xx&quot; HTTP error codes.</p><p>Faults <em>do</em> contribute to the overall API availability.</p><p>Calls that fail due to rate limiting or quota failures MUST NOT count as faults. Calls that fail as the result of a service fast-failing requests (often for its own protection) do count as faults.</p><h3 id="5.3.-latency">5.3. Latency</h3><p>Latency is defined as how long a particular API call takes to complete, measured as closely to the client as possible. This metric applies to both synchronous and asynchronous APIs in the same way. For long running calls, the latency is measured on the initial request and measures how long that call (not the overall operation) takes to complete.</p><h3 id="5.4.-time-to-complete">5.4. Time to complete</h3><p>Services that expose long operations MUST track &quot;Time to Complete&quot; metrics around those operations.</p><h3 id="5.5.-long-running-api-faults">5.5. Long running API faults</h3><p>For a Long Running API, it's possible for both the initial request which begins the operation and the request which retrieves the results to technically work (each passing back a 200) but for the underlying operation to have failed. Long Running faults MUST roll up as faults into the overall Availability metrics.</p><h2 id="6.-client-guidance">6. Client guidance</h2><p>To ensure the best possible experience for clients talking to a REST service, clients SHOULD adhere to the following best practices:</p><h3 id="6.1.-ignore-rule">6.1. Ignore rule</h3><p>For loosely coupled clients where the exact shape of the data is not known before the call, if the server returns something the client wasn't expecting, the client MUST safely ignore it.</p><p>Some services MAY add fields to responses without changing versions numbers. Services that do so MUST make this clear in their documentation and clients MUST ignore unknown fields.</p><h3 id="6.2.-variable-order-rule">6.2. Variable order rule</h3><p>Clients MUST NOT rely on the order in which data appears in JSON service responses. For example, clients SHOULD be resilient to the reordering of fields within a JSON object. When supported by the service, clients MAY request that data be returned in a specific order. For example, services MAY support the use of the <em>$orderBy</em> querystring parameter to specify the order of elements within a JSON array. Services MAY also explicitly specify the ordering of some elements as part of the service contract. For example, a service MAY always return a JSON object's &quot;type&quot; information as the first field in an object to simplify response parsing on the client. Clients MAY rely on ordering behavior explicitly identified by the service.</p><h3 id="6.3.-silent-fail-rule">6.3. Silent fail rule</h3><p>Clients requesting OPTIONAL server functionality (such as optional headers) MUST be resilient to the server ignoring that particular functionality.</p><h2 id="7.-consistency-fundamentals">7. Consistency fundamentals</h2><h3 id="7.1.-url-structure">7.1. URL structure</h3><p>Humans SHOULD be able to easily read and construct URLs.</p><p>This facilitates discovery and eases adoption on platforms without a well-supported client library.</p><p>An example of a well-structured URL is:</p><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/people/jdoe@contoso.com/inbox
</code></pre><p>An example URL that is not friendly is:</p><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>https://api.contoso.com/EWS/OData/Users('jdoe@microsoft.com')/Folders('AAMkADdiYzI1MjUzLTk4MjQtNDQ1Yy05YjJkLWNlMzMzYmIzNTY0MwAuAAAAAACzMsPHYH6HQoSwfdpDx-2bAQCXhUk6PC1dS7AERFluCgBfAAABo58UAAA=')
</code></pre><p>A frequent pattern that comes up is the use of URLs as values. Services MAY use URLs as values. For example, the following is acceptable:</p><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/items?url=https://resources.contoso.com/shoes/fancy
</code></pre><h3 id="7.2.-url-length">7.2. URL length</h3><p>The HTTP 1.1 message format, defined in RFC 7230, in section <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.1.1">3.1.1</a>, defines no length limit on the Request Line, which includes the target URL. From the RFC:</p><blockquote><p>HTTP does not place a predefined limit on the length of a request-line. [...] A server that receives a request-target longer than any URI it wishes to parse MUST respond with a 414 (URI Too Long) status code.</p></blockquote><p>Services that can generate URLs longer than 2,083 characters MUST make accommodations for the clients they wish to support. Here are some sources for determining what target clients support:</p><ul><li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184">https://stackoverflow.com/a/417184</a></li><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/</a></li></ul><p>Also note that some technology stacks have hard and adjustable URL limits, so keep this in mind as you design your services.</p><h3 id="7.3.-canonical-identifier">7.3. Canonical identifier</h3><p>In addition to friendly URLs, resources that can be moved or be renamed SHOULD expose a URL that contains a unique stable identifier. It MAY be necessary to interact with the service to obtain a stable URL from the friendly name for the resource, as in the case of the &quot;/my&quot; shortcut used by some services.</p><p>The stable identifier is not required to be a GUID.</p><p>An example of a URL containing a canonical identifier is:</p><pre class="prettyprint source"><code>https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/people/7011042402/inbox
</code></pre><h3 id="7.4.-supported-methods">7.4. Supported methods</h3><p>Operations MUST use the proper HTTP methods whenever possible, and operation idempotency MUST be respected. HTTP methods are frequently referred to as the HTTP verbs. The terms are synonymous in this context, however the HTTP specification uses the term method.</p><p>Below is a list of methods that Microsoft REST services SHOULD support. Not all resources will support all methods, but all resources using the methods below MUST conform to their usage.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th><th>Is Idempotent</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GET</td><td>Return the current value of an object</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td>PUT</td><td>Replace an object, or create a named object, when applicable</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td>DELETE</td><td>Delete an object</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td>POST</td><td>Create a new object based on the data provided, or submit a command</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><td>HEAD</td><td>Return metadata of an object for a GET response. Resources that support the GET method MAY support the HEAD method as well</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td>PATCH</td><td>Apply a partial update to an object</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><td>OPTIONS</td><td>Get information about a request; see below for details.</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table><p><small>Table 1</small></p><h4 id="7.4.1.-post">7.4.1. POST</h4><p>POST operations SHOULD support the Location response header to specify the location of any created resource that was not explicitly named, via the Location header.</p><p>As an example, imagine a service that allows creation of hosted servers, which will be named by the service:</p><pre class="prettyprint source lang-http"><code>POST http://api.contoso.com/account1/servers
</code></pre><p>The response would be something like:</p><pre class="prettyprint source lang-http"><code>201 Created
Location: http://api.contoso.com/account1/servers/server321
</code></pre><p>Where &quot;server321&quot; is the service-allocated server name.</p><p>Services MAY also return the full metadata for the created item in the response.</p><h4 id="7.4.2.-patch">7.4.2. PATCH</h4><p>PATCH has been standardized by IETF as the method to be used for updating an existing object incrementally (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789">RFC 5789</a>). Microsoft REST API Guidelines compliant APIs SHOULD support PATCH.</p><h4 id="7.4.3.-creating-resources-via-patch-(upsert-semantics)">7.4.3. Creating resources via PATCH (UPSERT semantics)</h4><p>Services that allow callers to specify key values on create SHOULD support UPSERT semantics, and those that do MUST support creating resources using PATCH. Because PUT is defined as a complete replacement of the content, it is dangerous for clients to use PUT to modify data. Clients that do not understand (and hence ignore) properties on a resource are not likely to provide them on a PUT when trying to update a resource, hence such properties could be inadvertently removed. Services MAY optionally support PUT to update existing resources, but if they do they MUST use replacement semantics (that is, after the PUT, the resource's properties MUST match what was provided in the request, including deleting any server properties that were not provided).</p><p>Under UPSERT semantics, a PATCH call to a nonexistent resource is handled by the server as a &quot;create&quot;, and a PATCH call to an existing resource is handled as an &quot;update&quot;. To ensure that an update request is not treated as a create or vice versa, the client MAY specify precondition HTTP headers in the request. The service MUST NOT treat a PATCH request as an insert if it contains an If-Match header and MUST NOT treat a PATCH request as an update if it contains an If-None-Match header with a value of &quot;*&quot;.</p><p>If a service does not support UPSERT, then a PATCH call against a resource that does not exist MUST result in an HTTP &quot;409 Conflict&quot; error.</p><h4 id="7.4.4.-options-and-link-headers">7.4.4. Options and link headers</h4><p>OPTIONS allows a client to retrieve information about a resource, at a minimum by returning the Allow header denoting the valid methods for this resource.</p><p>In addition, services SHOULD include a Link header (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988">RFC 5988</a>) to point to documentation for the resource in question:</p><pre class="prettyprint source lang-http"><code>Link: &lt;{help}>; rel=&quot;help&quot;
</code></pre><p>Where {help} is the URL to a documentation resource.</p><p>For examples on use of OPTIONS, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-preflight-requests">preflighting CORS cross-domain calls</a>.</p><h3 id="7.5.-standard-request-headers">7.5. Standard request headers</h3><p>The table of request headers below SHOULD be used by Microsoft REST API Guidelines services. Using these headers is not mandated, but if used they MUST be used consistently.</p><p>All header values MUST follow the syntax rules set forth in the specification where the header field is defined. Many HTTP headers are defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231">RFC7231</a>, however a complete list of approved headers can be found in the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml">IANA Header Registry</a>.&quot;</p><table><thead><tr><th>Header</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Authorization</td><td>String</td><td>Authorization header for the request</td></tr><tr><td>Date</td><td>Date</td><td>Timestamp of the request, based on the client's clock, in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.3">RFC 5322</a> date and time format. The server SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the accuracy of the client's clock. This header MAY be included in the request, but MUST be in this format when supplied. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) MUST be used as the time zone reference for this header when it is provided. For example: <code>Wed, 24 Aug 2016 18:41:30 GMT</code>. Note that GMT is exactly equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) for this purpose.</td></tr><tr><td>Accept</td><td>Content type</td><td>The requested content type for the response such as:<ul><li>application/xml</li><li>text/xml</li><li>application/json</li><li>text/javascript (for JSONP)</li></ul>Per the HTTP guidelines, this is just a hint and responses MAY have a different content type, such as a blob fetch where a successful response will just be the blob stream as the payload. For services following OData, the preference order specified in OData SHOULD be followed.</td></tr><tr><td>Accept-Encoding</td><td>Gzip, deflate</td><td>REST endpoints SHOULD support GZIP and DEFLATE encoding, when applicable. For very large resources, services MAY ignore and return uncompressed data.</td></tr><tr><td>Accept-Language</td><td>&quot;en&quot;, &quot;es&quot;, etc.</td><td>Specifies the preferred language for the response. Services are not required to support this, but if a service supports localization it MUST do so through the Accept-Language header.</td></tr><tr><td>Accept-Charset</td><td>Charset type like &quot;UTF-8&quot;</td><td>Default is UTF-8, but services SHOULD be able to handle ISO-8859-1.</td></tr><tr><td>Content-Type</td><td>Content type</td><td>Mime type of request body (PUT/POST/PATCH)</td></tr><tr><td>Prefer</td><td>return=minimal, return=representation</td><td>If the return=minimal preference is specified, services SHOULD return an empty body in response to a successful insert or update. If return=representation is specified, services SHOULD return the created or updated resource in the response. Services SHOULD support this header if they have scenarios where clients would sometimes benefit from responses, but sometimes the response would impose too much of a hit on bandwidth.</td></tr><tr><td>If-Match, If-None-Match, If-Range</td><td>String</td><td>Services that support updates to resources using optimistic concurrency control MUST support the If-Match header to do so. Services MAY also use other headers related to ETags as long as they follow the HTTP specification.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="7.6.-standard-response-headers">7.6. Standard response headers</h3><p>Services SHOULD return the following response headers, except where noted in the &quot;required&quot; column.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Response Header</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Date</td><td>All responses</td><td>Timestamp the response was processed, based on the server's clock, in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.3">RFC 5322</a> date and time format.

Used with If-Match, If-None-Match and If-Range to implement optimistic concurrency control.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="7.7.-custom-headers">7.7. Custom headers</h3><p>Custom headers MUST NOT be required for the basic operation of a given API.</p><p>Some of the guidelines in this document prescribe the use of nonstandard HTTP headers. In addition, some services MAY need to add extra functionality, which is exposed via HTTP headers. The following guidelines help maintain consistency across usage of custom headers.</p><p>Headers that are not standard HTTP headers MUST have one of two formats:</p><ol><li>A generic format for headers that are registered as &quot;provisional&quot; with IANA (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3864">RFC 3864</a>)</li><li>A scoped format for headers that are too usage-specific for registration</li></ol><p>These two formats are described below.</p><h3 id="7.8.-specifying-headers-as-query-parameters">7.8. Specifying headers as query parameters</h3><p>Some headers pose challenges for some scenarios such as AJAX clients, especially when making cross-domain calls where adding headers MAY not be supported. As such, some headers MAY be accepted as Query Parameters in addition to headers, with the same naming as the header:</p><p>Not all headers make sense as query parameters, including most standard HTTP headers.</p><p>The criteria for considering when to accept headers as parameters are:</p><ol><li>Any custom headers MUST be also accepted as parameters.</li><li>Required standard headers MAY be accepted as parameters.</li><li>Required headers with security sensitivity (e.g., Authorization header) MIGHT NOT be appropriate as parameters; the service owner SHOULD evaluate these on a case-by-case basis.</li></ol><p>The one exception to this rule is the Accept header. It's common practice to use a scheme with simple names instead of the full functionality described in the HTTP specification for Accept.</p><h3 id="7.9.-pii-parameters">7.9. PII parameters</h3><p>Consistent with their organization's privacy policy, clients SHOULD NOT transmit personally identifiable information (PII) parameters in the URL (as part of path or query string) because this information can be inadvertently exposed via client, network, and server logs and other mechanisms.</p><p>Consequently, a service SHOULD accept PII parameters transmitted as headers.</p><p>However, there are many scenarios where the above recommendations cannot be followed due to client or software limitations. To address these limitations, services SHOULD also accept these PII parameters as part of the URL consistent with the rest of these guidelines.</p><p>Services that accept PII parameters -- whether in the URL or as headers -- SHOULD be compliant with privacy policy specified by their organization's engineering leadership. This will typically include recommending that clients prefer headers for transmission and implementations adhere to special precautions to ensure that logs and other service data collection are properly handled.</p><h3 id="7.10.-response-formats">7.10. Response formats</h3><p>For organizations to have a successful platform, they must serve data in formats developers are accustomed to using, and in consistent ways that allow developers to handle responses with common code.</p><p>Web-based communication, especially when a mobile or other low-bandwidth client is involved, has moved quickly in the direction of JSON for a variety of reasons, including its tendency to be lighter weight and its ease of consumption with JavaScript-based clients.</p><p>JSON property names SHOULD be camelCased.</p><p>Services SHOULD provide JSON as the default encoding.</p><h4 id="7.10.1.-clients-specified-response-format">7.10.1. Clients-specified response format</h4><p>In HTTP, response format SHOULD be requested by the client using the Accept header. This is a hint, and the server MAY ignore it if it chooses to, even if this isn't typical of well-behaved servers. Clients MAY send multiple Accept headers and the service MAY choose one of them.</p><p>The default response format (no Accept header provided) SHOULD be application/json, and all services MUST support application/json.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Accept Header</th><th>Response type</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>application/json</td><td>Payload SHOULD be returned as JSON</td><td>Also accept text/javascript for JSONP cases</td></tr></tbody></table><pre class="prettyprint source lang-http"><code>GET https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/products/user
Accept: application/json
</code></pre><h4 id="7.10.2.-error-condition-responses">7.10.2. Error condition responses</h4><p>For non-success conditions, developers SHOULD be able to write one piece of code that handles errors consistently across different Microsoft REST API Guidelines services. This allows building of simple and reliable infrastructure to handle exceptions as a separate flow from successful responses. The following is based on the OData v4 JSON spec. However, it is very generic and does not require specific OData constructs. APIs SHOULD use this format even if they are not using other OData constructs.</p><p>The error response MUST be a single JSON object. This object MUST have a name/value pair named &quot;error&quot;. The value MUST be a JSON object.</p><p>This object MUST contain name/value pairs with the names &quot;code&quot; and &quot;message&quot;, and it MAY contain name/value pairs with the names &quot;target&quot;, &quot;details&quot; and &quot;innererror.&quot;</p><p>The value for the &quot;code&quot; name/value pair is a language-independent string. Its value is a service-defined error code that SHOULD be human-readable. This code serves as a more specific indicator of the error than the HTTP error code specified in the response. Services SHOULD have a relatively small number (about 20) of possible values for &quot;code&quot;, and all clients MUST be capable of handling all of them. Most services will require a much larger number of more specific error codes, which are not interesting to all clients. These error codes SHOULD be exposed in the &quot;innererror&quot; name/value pair as described below. Introducing a new value for &quot;code&quot; that is visible to existing clients is a breaking change and requires a version increase. Services can avoid breaking changes by adding new error codes to &quot;innererror&quot; instead.</p><p>The value for the &quot;message&quot; name/value pair MUST be a human-readable representation of the error. It is intended as an aid to developers and is not suitable for exposure to end users. Services wanting to expose a suitable message for end users MUST do so through an <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/os/odata-json-format-v4.0-os.html#_Instance_Annotations">annotation</a> or custom property. Services SHOULD NOT localize &quot;message&quot; for the end user, because doing so might make the value unreadable to the app developer who may be logging the value, as well as make the value less searchable on the Internet.</p><p>The value for the &quot;target&quot; name/value pair is the target of the particular error (e.g., the name of the property in error).</p><p>The value for the &quot;details&quot; name/value pair MUST be an array of JSON objects that MUST contain name/value pairs for &quot;code&quot; and &quot;message&quot;, and MAY contain a name/value pair for &quot;target&quot;, as described above. The objects in the &quot;details&quot; array usually represent distinct, related errors that occurred during the request. See example below.</p><p>The value for the &quot;innererror&quot; name/value pair MUST be an object. The contents of this object are service-defined. Services wanting to return more specific errors than the root-level code MUST do so by including a name/value pair for &quot;code&quot; and a nested &quot;innererror&quot;. Each nested &quot;innererror&quot; object represents a higher level of detail than its parent. When evaluating errors, clients MUST traverse through all of the nested &quot;innererrors&quot; and choose the deepest one that they understand. This scheme allows services to introduce new error codes anywhere in the hierarchy without breaking backwards compatibility, so long as old error codes still appear. The service MAY return different levels of depth and detail to different callers. For example, in development environments, the deepest &quot;innererror&quot; MAY contain internal information that can help debug the service. To guard against potential security concerns around information disclosure, services SHOULD take care not to expose too much detail unintentionally. Error objects MAY also include custom server-defined name/value pairs that MAY be specific to the code. Error types with custom server-defined properties SHOULD be declared in the service's metadata document. See example below.</p><p>Error responses MAY contain <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-json-format/v4.0/os/odata-json-format-v4.0-os.html#_Instance_Annotations">annotations</a> in any of their JSON objects.</p><p>We recommend that for any transient errors that may be retried, services SHOULD include a Retry-After HTTP header indicating the minimum number of seconds that clients SHOULD wait before attempting the operation again.</p><h5 id="errorresponse-%3A-object">ErrorResponse : Object</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>error</code></td><td>Error</td><td>✔</td><td>The error object.</td></tr></tbody></table><h5 id="error-%3A-object">Error : Object</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>code</code></td><td>String</td><td>✔</td><td>One of a server-defined set of error codes.</td></tr><tr><td><code>message</code></td><td>String</td><td>✔</td><td>A human-readable representation of the error.</td></tr><tr><td><code>target</code></td><td>String</td><td></td><td>The target of the error.</td></tr><tr><td><code>details</code></td><td>Error[]</td><td></td><td>An array of details about specific errors that led to this reported error.</td></tr><tr><td><code>innererror</code></td><td>InnerError</td><td></td><td>An object containing more specific information than the current object about the error.</td></tr></tbody></table><h5 id="innererror-%3A-object">InnerError : Object</h5><table><thead><tr><th>Property</th><th>Type</th><th>Required</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>code</code></td><td>String</td><td></td><td>A more specific error code than was provided by the containing error.</td></tr><tr><td><code>innererror</code></td><td>InnerError</td><td></td><td>An object containing more specific information than the current object about the error.</td></tr></tbody></table><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p>Example of &quot;innererror&quot;:</p><pre class="prettyprint source lang-json"><code>{

Avoiding preflight</h4><p>Because the CORS protocol can trigger preflight requests that add additional round trips to the server, performance-critical apps might be interested in avoiding them. The spirit behind CORS is to avoid preflight for any simple cross-domain requests that old non-CORS-capable browsers were able to make. All other requests require preflight.</p><p>A request is &quot;simple&quot; and avoids preflight if its method is GET, HEAD or POST, and if it doesn't contain any request headers besides Accept, Accept-Language and Content-Language. For POST requests, the Content-Type header is also allowed, but only if its value is &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;, &quot;multipart/form-data&quot; or &quot;text/plain.&quot; For any other headers or values, a preflight request will happen.</p><h3 id="8.2.-service-guidance">8.2. Service guidance</h3><p>At minimum, services MUST:</p><ul><li>Understand the Origin request header that browsers send on cross-domain requests, and the Access-Control-Request-Method request header that they send on preflight OPTIONS requests that check for access.</li><li>If the Origin header is present in a request:<ul><li>If the request uses the OPTIONS method and contains the Access-Control-Request-Method header, then it is a preflight request intended to probe for access before the actual request. Otherwise, it is an actual request. For preflight requests, beyond performing the steps below to add headers, services MUST perform no additional processing and MUST return a 200 OK. For non-preflight requests, the headers below are added in addition to the request's regular processing.</li><li>Add an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to the response, containing the same value as the Origin request header. Note that this requires services to dynamically generate the header value. Resources that do not require cookies or any other form of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/#user-credentials">user credentials</a> MAY respond with a wildcard asterisk (*) instead. Note that the wildcard is acceptable here only, and not for any of the other headers described below.</li><li>If the caller requires access to a response header that is not in the set of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/#simple-header">simple response headers</a> (Cache-Control, Content-Language, Content-Type, Expires, Last-Modified, Pragma), then add an Access-Control-Expose-Headers header containing the list of additional response header names the client should have access to.</li><li>If the request requires cookies, then add an Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header set to &quot;true.&quot;</li><li>If the request was a preflight request (see first bullet), then the service MUST:<ul><li>Add an Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header containing the list of request header names the client is permitted to use. This list need only contain headers that are not in the set of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/#simple-header">simple request headers</a> (Accept, Accept-Language, Content-Language). If there are no restrictions on headers the service accepts, the service MAY simply return the same value as the Access-Control-Request-Headers header sent by the client.</li><li>Add an Access-Control-Allow-Methods response header containing the list of HTTP methods the caller is permitted to use.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Add an Access-Control-Max-Age pref response header containing the number of seconds for which this preflight response is valid (and hence can be avoided before subsequent actual requests). Note that while it is customary to use a large value like 2592000 (30 days), many browsers self-impose a much lower limit (e.g., five minutes).</p><p>Because browser preflight response caches are notoriously weak, the additional round trip from a preflight response hurts performance. Services used by interactive Web clients where performance is critical SHOULD avoid patterns that cause a preflight request</p><ul><li><p>For GET and HEAD calls, avoid requiring request headers that are not part of the simple set above. Allow them to be provided as query parameters instead.</p><ul><li>The Authorization header is not part of the simple set, so the authentication token MUST be sent through the &quot;access_token&quot; query parameter instead, for resources requiring authentication. Note that passing authentication tokens in the URL is not recommended, because it can lead to the token getting recorded in server logs and exposed to anyone with access to those logs. Services that accept authentication tokens through the URL MUST take steps to mitigate the security risks, such as using short-lived authentication tokens, suppressing the auth token from getting logged, and controlling access to server logs.</li></ul></li><li><p>Avoid requiring cookies. XmlHttpRequest will only send cookies on cross-domain requests if the &quot;withCredentials&quot; attribute is set; this also causes a preflight request.</p><ul><li>Services that require cookie-based authentication MUST use a &quot;dynamic canary&quot; to secure all APIs that accept cookies.</li></ul></li><li><p>For POST calls, prefer simple Content-Types in the set of (&quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;, &quot;multipart/form-data&quot;, &quot;text/plain&quot;) where applicable. Any other Content-Type will induce a preflight request.</p><ul><li>Services MUST NOT contravene other API recommendations in the name of avoiding CORS preflight requests. In particular, in accordance with recommendations, most POST requests will actually require a preflight request due to the Content-Type.</li><li>If eliminating preflight is critical, then a service MAY support alternative mechanisms for data transfer, but the RECOMMENDED approach MUST also be supported.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition, when appropriate services MAY support the JSONP pattern for simple, GET-only cross-domain access. In JSONP, services take a parameter indicating the format (<em>$format=json</em>) and a parameter indicating a callback (<em>$callback=someFunc</em>), and return a text/javascript document containing the JSON response wrapped in a function call with the indicated name.

Clients MUST be prepared to deal with these discrepancies. The server SHOULD always encode the record ID of the last read record, helping the client in the process of managing repeated/missing results.</p><p><strong>Combining client- and server-driven paging:</strong> Note that client-driven paging does not preclude server-driven paging.

Clients MAY issue a GET on some resource to determine the state of a long running operation</li><li>Long running operations SHOULD work for clients looking to &quot;Fire and Forget&quot; and for clients looking to actively monitor and act upon results.</li><li>Cancellation does not explicitly mean rollback. On a per-API defined case it may mean rollback, or compensation, or completion, or partial completion, etc. Following a cancelled operation, It SHOULD NOT be a client's responsibility to return the service to a consistent state which allows continued service.</li></ol><h3 id="13.1.-resource-based-long-running-operations-(relo)">13.1. Resource based long running operations (RELO)</h3><p>Resource based modeling is where the status of an operation is encoded in the resource and the wire protocol used is the standard synchronous protocol. In this model state transitions are well defined and goal states are similarly defined.</p><p><em>This is the preferred model for long running operations and should be used wherever possible.</em> Avoiding the complexity and mechanics of the LRO Wire Protocol makes things simpler for our users and tooling chain.</p><p>An example may be a machine reboot, where the operation itself completes synchronously but the GET operation on the virtual machine resource would have a &quot;state: Rebooting&quot;, &quot;state: Running&quot; that could be queried at any time.</p><p>This model MAY integrate Push Notifications.</p><p>While most operations are likely to be POST semantics, in addition to POST semantics, services MAY support PUT semantics via routing to simplify their APIs. For example, a user that wants to create a database named &quot;db1&quot; could call:</p><pre class="prettyprint source lang-http"><code>PUT https://api.contoso.com/v1.0/databases/db1
</code></pre><p>In this scenario the databases segment is processing the PUT operation.</p><p>Services MAY also use the hybrid defined below.</p><h3 id="13.2.-stepwise-long-running-operations">13.2. Stepwise long running operations</h3><p>A stepwise operation is one that takes a long, and often unpredictable, length of time to complete, and doesn't offer state transition modeled in the resource. This section outlines the approach that services should use to expose such long running operations.</p><p>Service MAY expose stepwise operations.</p><blockquote><p>Stepwise Long Running Operations are sometimes called &quot;Async&quot; operations. This causes confusion, as it mixes elements of platforms (&quot;Async / await&quot;, &quot;promises&quot;, &quot;futures&quot;) with elements of API operation. This document uses the term &quot;Stepwise Long Running Operation&quot; or often just &quot;Stepwise Operation&quot; to avoid confusion over the word &quot;Async&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>Services MUST perform as much synchronous validation as practical on stepwise requests. Services MUST prioritize returning errors in a synchronous way, with the goal of having only &quot;Valid&quot; operations processed using the long running operation wire protocol.</p><p>For an API that's defined as a Stepwise Long Running Operation the service MUST go through the Stepwise Long Running Operation flow even if the operation can be completed immediately. In other words, APIs must adopt and stick with an LRO pattern and not change patterns based on circumstance.</p><h4 id="13.2.1.-put">13.2.1.

Services that support cancellation MUST sufficiently describe their cancellation such that the state of the system can be accurately determined, and any compensating actions may be run.</p><p>Services that support additional states should consider this list of canonical names and avoid creating new names if possible: Cancelling, Cancelled, Aborting, Aborted, Tombstone, Deleting, Deleted.</p><p>An operation MUST contain, and provide in the GET response, the following information:</p><ol><li>The timestamp when the operation was created.</li><li>A timestamp for when the current state was entered.</li><li>The operation state (notstarted / running / completed).</li></ol><p>Services MAY add additional, API specific, fields into the operation.

Throttling, Quotas, and Limits</h2><h3 id="14.1.-principles">14.1. Principles</h3><p>Services should be as responsive as possible, so as not to block callers. As a rule of thumb any API call that is expected to take longer than 0.5 seconds in the 99th percentile, should consider using the Long-running Operations pattern for those calls. Obviously, services cannot guarantee these response times in the face of potentially unlimited load from callers. Services should therefore design and document call request limits for clients, and respond with appropriate, actionable errors and error messages if these limits are exceeded. Services should respond quickly with an error when they are generally overloaded, rather than simply respond slowly. Finally, many services will have quotas on calls, perhaps a number of operations per hour or day, usually related to a service plan or price. When these quotas are exceeded services must also provide immediate, actionable errors. Quotas and Limits should be scoped to a customer unit: a subscription, a tenant, an application, a plan, or without any other identification a range of ip addresses…as appropriate to the service goals so that the load is properly shared and one unit is not interfering with another.</p><h3 id="14.2.-return-codes-(429-vs-503)">14.2. Return Codes (429 vs 503)</h3><p>HTTP specifies two return codes for these scenarios: '429 Too Many Requests' and '503 Service Unavailable'. Services should use 429 for cases where clients are making too many calls and can fix the situation by changing their call pattern. Services should respond with 503 in cases where general load or other problems outside the control of the individual callers is responsible for the service becoming slow. In all cases, services should also provide information suggesting how long the callers should wait before trying in again. Clients should respect these headers and also implement other transient fault handling techniques. However, there may be clients that simply retry immediately upon failure, potentially increasing the load on the service. To handle this, services should design so that returning 429 or 503 is as inexpensive as possible, either by putting in special fastpath code, or ideally by depending on a common frontdoor or load balancer that provides this functionality.</p><h3 id="14.3.-retry-after-and-ratelimit-headers">14.3. Retry-After and RateLimit Headers</h3><p>The Retry-After header is the standard way for responding to clients who are being throttled. It is also common, but optional, in the case of limits and quotas (but not overall system load) to respond with header describing the limit that was exceeded. However, services across Microsoft and the industry use a wide range of different headers for this purpose. We recommend using three headers to describe the limit, the number of calls remaining under the limit, and the time when the limit will reset. However, other headers may be appropriate for specific types of limits. In all cases these must be documented.</p><h3 id="14.4.-service-guidance">14.4. Service Guidance</h3><p>Services should choose time windows as appropriate for the SLAs or business objectives. In the case of Quotas, the Retry-After time and time window may be very long (hours, days, weeks, even months. Services use 429 to indicate the specific caller has made too many calls, and 503 to indicate that the service is load shedding but that it is not the caller’s responsibility.</p><h4 id="14.4.1.-responsiveness">14.4.1.

Push notifications via webhooks</h2><h3 id="15.1.-scope">15.1. Scope</h3><p>Services MAY implement push notifications via web hooks.

It's intended as a minimal set of requirements and as a starting point for additional functionality.</p><h3 id="15.2.-principles">15.2. Principles</h3><p>The core principles for services that support web hooks are:</p><ol><li>Services MUST implement at least a poke/pull model. In the poke/pull model, a notification is sent to a client, and clients then send a request to get the current state or the record of change since their last notification. This approach avoids complexities around message ordering, missed messages, and change sets. Services MAY add more data to provide rich notifications.</li><li>Services MUST implement the challenge/response protocol for configuring callback URLs.</li><li>Services SHOULD have a recommended age-out period, with flexibility for services to vary based on scenario.</li><li>Services SHOULD allow subscriptions that are raising successful notifications to live forever and SHOULD be tolerant of reasonable outage periods.</li><li>Firehose subscriptions MUST be delivered only over HTTPS. Services SHOULD require other subscription types to be HTTPS. See the &quot;Security&quot; section for more details.</li></ol><h3 id="15.3.-types-of-subscriptions">15.3. Types of subscriptions</h3><p>There are two subscription types, and services MAY implement either, both, or none. The supported subscription types are:</p><ol><li>Firehose subscriptions – a subscription is manually created for the subscribing application, typically in an app registration portal. Notifications of activity that any users have consented to the app receiving are sent to this single subscription.</li><li>Per-resource subscriptions – the subscribing application uses code to programmatically create a subscription at runtime for some user-specific entity(s).</li></ol><p>Services that support both subscription types SHOULD provide differentiated developer experiences for the two types:</p><ol><li>Firehose – Services MUST NOT require developers to create code except to directly verify and respond to notifications. Services MUST provide administrative UI for subscription management. Services SHOULD NOT assume that end users are aware of the subscription, only the subscribing application's functionality.</li><li>Per-user – Services MUST provide an API for developers to create and manage subscriptions as part of their app as well as verifying and responding to notifications. Services MAY expect end users to be aware of subscriptions and MUST allow end users to revoke subscriptions where they were created directly in response to user actions.</li></ol><h3 id="15.4.-call-sequences">15.4. Call sequences</h3><p>The call sequence for a firehose subscription MUST follow the diagram below.
